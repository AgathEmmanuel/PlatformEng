Infra management tool  
Servers  
Networking  
Storage  
  
Infra defined as code  
  
  
Terraform is not for config management  
  
Designing with config management not needed approach  
  
Packer  
Immutable infrastructure  
- config and software can only be updated by replacing the instance  
Disposable infrastructure  


you can freely use data from 1 resource to create another  

Execution plan  
IAC code is compared with state and a plan is created  
Resource Graph (is data structure used to figure out plan)  
directed acyclic graph  



> AWS terraform setup   

IAM -> Add User -> programming access -> AdministratorAccess  

~/.aws/credentials  

[default]  
aws_access_key_id=  
aws_secret_access_key=  





> Features

Infra automation
Open source
Declarative syntax
Push based deployment
Integrate multiple providers
Abstract and Reusable components
Idempotent and Consistent
Repeatable

terraform reach out to the api for any given service and tell it what to create  

executable  
cofiguration files ( .tf files, in json or HCL )
provider plugins  
state data 


> commands  

```

terraform version  
terraform -help  

terraform init   

terraform plan    	   	# outputs a plan
terraform plan -destroy    	# ouputs plan to destroy
terraform plan -destroy -out=example.plan    	# saves to output file
terraform show example.plan    	# shows the plan 
terraform plan --help
terraform apply
terraform destroy


terraform state 		# state(reality) of your infra, the local represetation teraform keeps
terraform state list 		# list all resource names  
terraform state mv
terraform state pull
terraform state push
terraform state rm
terraform state show resorce_name 

terraform state show <resource type>
terraform state show <resource_type.name>
	
terraform state mv <source> <destination>

terraform state rm <resource type>

terraform graph      #generates a graph outupt which can be pasted in webgraphviz.com to view graphically



terraform plan -destroy -out=example.plan    	# saves to output file
terraform apply example.plan
terraform apply -auto-approve


terraform graph | grep -v -e 'meta' -e 'vpc' 	# -v means to exclude, -e means the expressions to be excluded



```


Resources 
- different settngs for every provider  

Terraform style  
- indent 2 spaces  
- single meta-arguments first  
- block meta-aruments last  
- blank lines for clarity  
- group single arguments  
- readability  
- equal signs should be lined up  


Terraform Advanced  
- variables  
- spliting out data  
- modules  


registry.terraform.io    # here there are prewritten modules that u can use in your code  



For a basic example:
vpc 
a public subnet  
ec2  
routing resources  
security groups  

blocks:  
providers - the cloud provider you want to use, along with account and region  
resources - any resource like instance, database, etc.  
data sources - asking for information for configs from cloud providers  



IaC : Provisioning infra via software to get consistent and predictable deployments
stored in source control

```
blocktype "label" "namelabel" {
  key = "value"
  nestedblock {
    key = "value"
  }
}

```

Data in terraform  

input variables  
local values  
output values  

data types  

primitives  string,number,boolean
collection  list,set,map
structural  tuple,object

looping constructs  

Count  		integer  
For_each  	map or set  
Dynamic blocks  map or set





Variable values priority  

TF_VAR_ environment variable 
terraform.tfvars  
terraform.tfvars.json  
.auto.tfvars  
.auto.tfvars.json
-var-file flag  
-var flag 
default value 
cmd prompt  



```
variable "variable_name" {
  type = type_value	
  description = "description_value"
  default = "default_value"
  sensitive = true|false
}
  
```


splitting resources in separate files inprove readability 
terraform state data (stored in JSON format)  should not be altered directly  

terraform modules  
module components:  
input variables  
output values  
resources and data sources  













## Getting started with Terraform for Google Cloud


- terraform resources  
- variables  
- output values  
- declarative  
- code management  
- auditable  
- portable  



ex

IAC:  Launch a GKE cluster
Configuration management:  Deploy containers into the GKE cluster


HCL:  Hashicoprp Configuration Language

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
terraform fmt


security and governance team sets constraints


terraform validator

gcloud beta terraform vet
executing the command enforces the policy compliance as part 
of the infrasturucture CI/CD pipeline






```

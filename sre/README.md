# SRE  


gets involved at designing stage  
capcity planning to make sure there is enough capacity to serve new traffic  
make sure we have a service document  
conduct postmortems for incidents  
make sure there is monitoring/alert setup  
be available oncall  
help developers push changes frequently  
efficiency and performance  
emergency response  
change management  


SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team  
SRE implements DevOps principles

Open Stack  

trouble shooting  



Middleware  

Middleware is software which lies between an operating system and the applications running on it  





• Infrastructure expertise across multiple technologies including storage, server infrastructure, data center operations and virtualisation
• Strong experience with Linux/Unix
• Proficiency in one or more scripting languages (Perl/Python/Bash/Ruby)
• Experience in Mysql and any NoSQL database technology
• Monitoring and instrumentation setup and design
• Basic network debugging skills
• Understanding of TCP/IP stack and related protocols
• Deep understanding of Layer 7 protocols like HTTP, DHCP, DNS, SSL/TLS
• Excellent written and verbal communication skills
• Ability to work under pressure
• Ability to prioritize and manage time efficiently
• Sound soft skills to get along with colleagues from other teams in order to harness the development process
• Expertise in big data applications including Hadoop (CDH/HDP), Hive, Cassandra, Vertical ElasticSearch, etc is a BIG PLUS.
• Ability to break down a bigger problem into smaller chunks is an added advantage
• Advanced Network debugging skills with different tools

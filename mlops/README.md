## Course  
[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)  


Note just build the ml model, but also put them in production  
Systematically plan out the lifecycle of an ML project  
- Scoping  
    - Define the project  
- Data  
    - Define data and establish baseline  
    - Label and organize data  
- Modeling  
    - Select and train model  
    - Perform error analysis  
- Deployment  
    - Deploy in production  
    - Monitor and maintain systems  

## ML Pipelines on GCP  

TFX pipelines  
MLflow  
Kubeflow    	: outofbox support for top frameworks like pytorch, tf and xgboost  
Cloud Composer  
AI platform pipelines  




- Model should be under version control
- Entire process from dataset creation to training to deployment must be driven by code  
- Retraining can be triggered by code changes and no-code changes froma a single entry point  
- Easy to monitor performance of models and fix some subset of issues arising without modifying model code  
- CI/CD for kubeflow pipelines  
- Training, Tuning and Serving on ML Platform  
- scalable ML services should be setup  
- Pipelines should be reusable  following the idea of LEGO blocks  
- a market place to publish your solutions like AI Hub in gcp  




Problems  
- keeping track of models, code, hyperparameter values chosen, metrics being evaluated, ideas  
- reproducability is a major concern  
- data scientists want to rerun the best models with minor parameter sweeps  
- team should be able to successfully train a model make it ready for production in a streamlined fashion  
- models in production need to be updated on a regular basis as new data comes in  
- performance, agility and teaceability is important  
- Training phase:    Labeled data => Ml algorithm => Trained model  
- Inference phase:   New data => Served Model => Predictions  
- reduce the time between analyzing the problem, creating models, deploying the solution, maintaining output quality  
- DevOps CI/CD :    Check out code => Perform unit testing => merge and Checkout Code => Build => Test => Release  
- MlOPs CI/CD  :    DevOps CI/CD +   Continous Training:    Serve => Monitor => Measure => Retrain   
- need to test and validate data, data schemes and models  
- need to consider technical depth while building and operating ML system  
- challenges:  model decay, deployment & testing complexity, multi-functional teams, experimental nature  
- Automate training, validation, and depoloyment with inclution of human validation in the loop  
- anyone in the organisation should be able to use the pipelines, modify it and use it  


Ml Project life cycle  
- Defining business use case  
- Data exploration  
- selecting algorithm  
- Data pipeline & feature engineering  
- Build ML model  
- Evaluate  
- Presenting results  
- Deployment of the model  
- Operationalizing the model  
- Monitoring model

### Data centric ai vs Model centric  
Caring more about data quality than data quantity

1. Data label quality  
2. Data augmentation  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Data versioning  
5. Domain knowledge  


Benefits of data-centric approach  

The advantages of becoming more data-centric are numerous, ranging from improved reporting speed and accuracy to better-informed decision-making. Data-centric infrastructure comes with lots of benefits:  
  
    Improves accuracy, using data as a strategic asset effectively assures more precise estimates, observations, and decisions.   
    Eliminates complex data transformations.  
    Reduces data errors and inconsistencies.  
    Provides valuable insights into internal and external trends that help you make better decisions.  
    Reduces expenses.  
    Makes data more accessible to key stakeholders.  
    Reduce data redundancy.  
    Improves data quality and reliability.  
  
  
  
  












MLOps is concerned with deploying the ML system and the continous evoulution of the models

MLOps principles include

-    Framing ML problems from business objectives
-    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-    Architect ML and data solutions for the problem
-    Data Prep and Feature Engineering
-    Model training and experimentation â€” data science
-    Model training and tuning
-    Building and automating ML pipelines
-    Deploying models to the production system
-    Model review and governance
-    Model inference and serving

## Migrating Apache Spark ML Jobs to Spark + Tensorflow on Kubeflow  
- Install Kubeflow on kubeflow ( use the spark-operator )   
- Use spark in notebook on KF  
- Take Spark job and split it into feature prep and model training  
- have the feature prep job save results in a TF-compatible format  
- create a TF-job  
- Create a Kubeflow (or Argo..) pipeline to train the new model  
- Optional: Use katib to do hyper-parameter tuning  
- Validate if the classic ML or new fancy ML works better  


A traditional Spark ML pipeline  
```
prepPipeline.setStages(Array(
 extensionIndexer,
 tokenizer,
 word2vec,
 featureVec, calssifier))
```
Splitting the Spark ML pipline  
```
prepPipeline.setStages(Array(
 extensionIndexer,
 tokenizer,
 word2vec,
 featureVec))  
```
Making a TF job to use the Spark job output  



## Kubeflow is a Buffet and it includes many options  
- argo  
- automation  
- chainer-job  
- core  
- credential-pod-preset  
- katlib  
- mpi-job  
- mxnet-job  
- openmpi  
- pachyderm  
- pytorch-job  
- seldon  
- spark  
- tfServing  

In General the peices in ML should inclde  
- ML libraries  
- ML models which are version controlled  
- data prep  
- Model management (persistance/deployment/CI)  
- Model Serving  



Research is great  
Everyone else have to manage and put models in prod  
Kubeflow bridges the gap from lab to production  
Allows to answer questions like  
- We want to know in the middle of quarter Why sales are down, and How to fix them
